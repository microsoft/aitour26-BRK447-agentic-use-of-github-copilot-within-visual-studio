# PRD: Add Mock Payment Server / Payment Service to Zava-Aspire

Date: 2025-08-22
Author: Bruno Capuano & Copilot (documentation draft)

This document describes a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for adding a mock payment processing capability to the Zava-Aspire solution located in `src/`.

Purpose

- Provide a lightweight, mock payment flow for the `Store` frontend so checkout can be demonstrated end-to-end without integrating a real payment provider.
- Introduce a new Blazor Server-based Payment Service that is registered with .NET Aspire and persists payment records to a new `paymentsdb`.

Scope (what we'll deliver)

- A new Blazor Server project `src/PaymentsService` that exposes an API and a web UI to view processed payments.
- Integration points in `src/ZavaAppHost` to provision `paymentsdb` and pass the connection string to the Payment Service via Aspire configuration.
- A mock payment dialog/flow in `src/Store` that prompts the user at checkout and calls the Payment Service `POST /api/payments` endpoint.

Key success criteria

- The Store checkout flow invokes a mock payment prompt and posts purchase details to the Payment Service.
- The Payment Service stores each payment in `paymentsdb` and the Payments UI shows persisted payments.

Quick checklist (maps to user requirements)

- [ ] Mock server design: described in this PRD (processing, storage, UI).
- [ ] Checkout prompt: Store UI triggers mock payment and returns a selected mock payment method.
- [ ] New Blazor Payment Service: project created under `src/`, registered with Aspire.
- [ ] API endpoint: `POST /api/payments` and `GET /api/payments` documented in this PRD.
- [ ] Persist payments: records saved in `paymentsdb`.
- [ ] Aspire host: provisions `paymentsdb` and passes connection string.
- [ ] Payments UI: grid showing processed payments with optional product enrichment.

Assumptions

- Repository targets .NET 9 and the Aspire host is already configured in `src/ZavaAppHost`.
- Local dev uses project references and file-based or lightweight DBs (SQLite) by default for demos.
- No real payment gateway integration is required; this is a sandbox/mock flow only.

Design overview

- Service: `PaymentsService` (Blazor Server, net9.0) — exposes Web API for payments and a Blazor UI to view stored payments.
- Storage: `paymentsdb` — created/provisioned by the Aspire host; suggested provider for local dev: SQLite (file: `Data/payments.db`).
- Frontend: `Store` will show a mock payment dialog at checkout and call the Payment Service API.

Project layout suggestion

- `src/PaymentsService/`
  - `PaymentsService.csproj` (net9.0)
  - `Program.cs` (Aspire registration comments and wiring)
  - `Controllers/PaymentsController.cs` (API)
  - `Pages/Payments.razor` (grid UI)
  - `Services/IPaymentRepository.cs`, `PaymentRepository.cs` (data access)
  - `Models/PaymentRecord.cs`, `DTOs/CreatePaymentRequest.cs`, `DTOs/PaymentResponse.cs`
  - `Data/PaymentsDbContext.cs` (EF Core)
  - `Services/ProductEnricher.cs` (optional enrichment from Products DB)

API contract

- POST `/api/payments`
  - Request (JSON):
    - `storeId?: string`
    - `userId: string`
    - `cartId?: string`
    - `currency: string` (e.g. `USD`)
    - `amount: decimal`
    - `items: [{ productId: string, quantity: int, unitPrice: decimal }]`
    - `paymentMethod: string` (masked)
    - `metadata?: object`
  - Response: `201 Created` with body `{ paymentId: string, status: "Success" | "Failed", processedAt: string }`

- GET `/api/payments`
  - Query: `page`, `pageSize`, `status?`
  - Response: `{ items: PaymentRecord[], totalCount: int }`

Data model (paymentsdb)

- Table: `Payments` (columns)
  - `PaymentId` (GUID PK)
  - `UserId` (string)
  - `StoreId` (string)
  - `CartId` (string)
  - `Currency` (string)
  - `Amount` (decimal)
  - `Status` (string)
  - `PaymentMethod` (string)
  - `ItemsJson` (text)
  - `ProductEnrichmentJson` (text)
  - `CreatedAt` (datetime)
  - `ProcessedAt` (datetime)

Implementation details

1) Payment Service (Blazor Server)

- Use EF Core with SQLite for local demos (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`). Provide an abstraction so provider can be changed.
- Register the Payment Service in Aspire (service registration + health checks). Add inline comments in `Program.cs` where Aspire-related wiring occurs.
- Implement `PaymentsController` with the two endpoints above. Validate incoming request and persist via `PaymentRepository`.

2) Aspire host changes (`src/ZavaAppHost/Program.cs`)

- Provision `paymentsdb` for local dev (create `Data/payments.db`) and expose connection string via configuration key `ConnectionStrings:PaymentsDb` or `PaymentsDb__ConnectionString`.
- Register the new service name (e.g., `payments-service`) in Aspire's service registration so `Store` can discover it. Add comment lines where this is configured.

3) Store frontend changes

- On the checkout page (`/checkout`), present a mock payment dialog with default user payment options. The dialog returns a `paymentMethod` string.
- Add a typed `HttpClient` named `PaymentsClient` in DI:

  - `builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IPaymentsClient, PaymentsClient>(client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri(configuration["Services:PaymentsService"] ?? "http://localhost:5004"));`

- Call `POST /api/payments` with the CreatePaymentRequest DTO.

4) Product enrichment

- PaymentsService may optionally call the Products service API to map `productId` to product `title` or `sku` for display. This should be implemented behind a feature flag and be tolerant to failures.

Configuration & local defaults

- Suggested local ports:
  - PaymentsService: `http://localhost:5004`
  - Store (existing): keep current port; use Aspire discovery in runtime.
- Env/config keys:
  - `ConnectionStrings:PaymentsDb`
  - `Services:PaymentsService` (base URL)
  - `Payments:MockMode` (bool) — when true, simulate payment responses, else behave as configured.

Security & privacy notes

- Do not log raw card data. Use masked payment method strings only.
- For local demo, authentication between services may be relaxed; for production, enable service-to-service authentication via Aspire.

Testing & validation

- Unit tests: `PaymentRepository`, `PaymentsController`.
- Integration test: start Aspire host + PaymentsService + Store and run a test checkout flow; assert a row in `paymentsdb`.
- Manual smoke: Run Store, go to `/checkout`, perform mock payment, verify success and payment visible at Payments UI.

Acceptance criteria (detailed)

- [ ] Payment Service project exists at `src/PaymentsService` and targets `net9.0`.
- [ ] PaymentsService registers with Aspire (commented location in `Program.cs`).
- [ ] Aspire host provisions `paymentsdb` and exposes connection string to PaymentsService.
- [ ] Store shows a mock payment dialog at checkout and posts to PaymentsService.
- [ ] PaymentsService persists payment records and makes them available via `GET /api/payments`.
- [ ] Payments UI displays payments in a pageable/sortable grid and shows product titles when enrichment is available.

Developer implementation checklist (detailed tasks)

1. Create Blazor Server project: `dotnet new blazorserver -n PaymentsService -o src/PaymentsService --framework net9.0`.
2. Add NuGet packages: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`, Aspire packages, `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` (optional).
3. Implement `PaymentsDbContext`, `PaymentRecord` model and EF Core migrations.
4. Implement `PaymentsController` endpoints and repository.
5. Implement `Pages/Payments.razor` grid using a lightweight table component or HTML table.
6. Update `src/ZavaAppHost/Program.cs` to provision `paymentsdb` and register the service.
7. Update `src/Store` to add `PaymentsClient` typed HttpClient and a mock payment dialog component.
8. Add unit and integration tests.

Open questions for reviewers

- Preferred DB provider for CI and production? (SQLite for local demos, SQL Server or Azure SQL for production.)
- Confirm default local port for PaymentsService (suggest `5004`).
- Confirm authentication approach for service-to-service calls in non-local environments.

Rollout plan

1. Add the PaymentsService skeleton with in-memory persistence and `POST /api/payments`.
2. Wire Aspire host to provide `paymentsdb` connection string.
3. Switch in EF Core SQLite and run migrations.
4. Add UI page and enrichment.
5. Update Store and add E2E tests.

Mapping back to user requirements

- Mock server to process checkout & payments — covered under "Design overview" and API contract.
- Checkout prompt on the Store — covered under "Store frontend changes".
- New Blazor project & Aspire enrollment — covered under "Project layout" and Aspire host changes.
- API endpoint & DB persistence — covered under "API contract" and "Data model".
- Aspire host create `paymentsdb` — covered under "Aspire host changes".
- Payments UI — covered under "Pages/Payments.razor" and the UI section.

Notes

- This PRD intentionally does not change code. Implementation work should be done in a follow-up PR. Add inline comments in code where Aspire registration and DB provisioning occur so reviewers can verify compliance.
